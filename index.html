          <section class="about-text">
            <p>
              Cricket, once governed purely by instinct and experience, has
              evolved into a sport heavily influenced by data-driven decisions.
              From team selection to in-game strategy, performance analytics has
              become central to gaining a competitive edge. The rise of global
              tournaments, fantasy leagues, and high-stakes international
              fixtures has intensified the demand for intelligent systems that
              can interpret player performance and predict match outcomes with
              reliability.
              <br /><br />
              This project, titled <b>Cricklytics</b>, is built around the core
              idea of transforming raw cricket performance data into actionable
              insights. It aims to simulate how selectors, analysts, and
              strategists might approach key decisions if they had access to a
              fully quantified view of player capabilities. <br /><br />
              The primary objectives of this project are twofold:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Best XI Selector:</b> Given a set of international teams, the
                system dynamically constructs an optimal playing XI based on
                player roles, historical consistency, and all-round performance.
                It ensures balance across key roles such as openers,
                middle-order anchors, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist
                bowlers, emulating the complexity of real-world team
                composition.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Win Probability Estimator:</b> By analyzing the performance
                strength of individual squads, the model predicts the likelihood
                of one team defeating another. This feature is designed to
                simulate pre-match strategy scenarios, aiding analysts, fans,
                and fantasy players in anticipating likely outcomes based on
                past performance data.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The design of Cricklytics is inspired by how modern teams evaluate
              players not just on reputation or individual stats in isolation,
              but on how their roles, styles, and impact align with broader team
              dynamics. By objectively scoring each player's contribution across
              multiple dimensions, Cricklytics delivers a comprehensive and
              unbiased framework for team analysis and match prediction.
              <br /><br />
              The system will rely on advanced data processing, feature
              engineering, performance modeling, and ML-driven decision-making.
              It can serve applications in sports analytics, fantasy leagues,
              coaching dashboards, and strategic planning for team management.
              <br /><br />
              Ultimately, this system reflects the future of cricket
              intelligence — where intuition meets data, and selection meets
              simulation.

                high-performing players across different formats and roles?
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Can we dynamically identify the best possible playing XI from
                any set of international teams while maintaining a balanced
                structure of batting, bowling, and all-round capabilities?

              Player Role Classification and Selection Criteria

            <p>
              Constructing a balanced and high-performing cricket team requires
              more than just selecting players with impressive statistics. The
              best teams are those that strategically distribute roles across
              batting, bowling, and all-round capabilities while ensuring
              adaptability to various match conditions. This section outlines
              the data-driven methodology employed to identify the Best Playing
              XI, ensuring each selected player fits a well-defined cricketing
              role based on historical performance metrics.
              <br /><br />
              To simulate real-world team composition logic, the squad was
              designed to include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>• 2 Openers</li>
              <li>• 3 Middle-Order Anchors</li>
              <li>• 1 Finisher</li>
              <li>• 2 All-Rounders</li>
              <li>• 3 Specialist Fast Bowlers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each category has distinct expectations, and thus, role-specific
              selection criteria were developed as follows:
            </p>

            <h4>Openers (2 Players)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                • Batting Average > 30: Reflects consistency and ability to
                occupy the crease
              </li>
              <li>• Strike Rate > 140: Indicates aggressive scoring ability</li>
              <li>
                • Boundary Percentage > 50%: Shows intent and ability to
                dominate bowlers early
              </li>
              <li>
                • Players with an average batting position of 1-2 and a high
                boundary conversion rate were prioritized.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Middle-Order Batsmen (3 Players)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                • Batting Average > 40: Ensures reliability under pressure
              </li>
              <li>
                • Strike Rate > 125: Balances aggression with sustainability
              </li>
              <li>
                • Average Balls Faced > 20: Indicates capacity to build an
                innings and absorb pressure
              </li>
              <li>
                • These players typically bat in positions 3-5 and anchor the
                innings during middle overs.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Finisher (1 Player)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                • Batting Average > 25: Demonstrates ability to score
                consistently
              </li>
              <li>
                • Strike Rate > 130: Emphasizes explosive scoring in short
                timeframes
              </li>
              <li>
                • Batting Position > 5 and Avg Balls Faced > 15: Indicates
                lower-order presence with enough impact time
              </li>
              <li>
                • Additionally, finishers who contributed with the ball were
                marked for bonus consideration.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>All-Rounders (2 Players)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                • Batting Average > 15 and Strike Rate > 140: Indicates useful
                contributions with the bat
              </li>
              <li>
                • Bowling Economy < 7 and Bowling Strike Rate < 20: Reflects
                efficiency and wicket-taking ability
              </li>

              <p>
                Effective data preparation is the foundation for any successful
                analytics project. In Cricklytics, we worked with scraped JSON
                data from ESPNcricinfo and transformed it into structured,
                reliable, and linkable CSV datasets. The entire preprocessing
                pipeline was broken down into four major components: match
                summary, batting, bowling, and player metadata. Each was
                cleaned, standardized, and made analysis-ready.

              <h2>Metric Definition & Design Using DAX Logic</h2>
              <p>
                To derive meaningful insights from raw cricket performance data,
                we developed a curated set of measures and calculated columns.
                These metrics serve as the foundation for player evaluation,
                comparison, and modeling. All DAX logic was derived from
                cricketing principles and mapped directly to the processed
                tables (batting Summary, bowling Summary).
              </p>

                <li>
                  <b>Boundary Percentage:</b> Measures how much of a player's
                  runs come from boundaries; high value indicates aggressive
                  batting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Average Balls Faced per Innings:</b> Gives insight into a
                  player's ability to handle pressure and anchor long innings.

                  <b>Total Innings Bowled:</b> Number of matches bowled;
                  indicates experience and workload.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Dot Ball Percentage:</b> How often the bowler delivers
                  non-scoring balls; identifies pressure builders and economical
                  bowlers.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>🧮 Calculated Columns for Enhanced Insight</h3>

            <h2>Best XI Selector Role-Based Team Optimization</h2>
            <h3>🎯 Objective</h3>
            <p>
              The Best XI Selector is designed to automatically generate the
              most balanced and high-performing cricket team from any given set
              of countries. It ensures the selected XI covers all critical
              roles—openers, middle-order batters, finishers, all-rounders, and
              bowlers—while maximizing overall impact using a custom scoring
              system.
            </p>

            <h3>🧠 Selection Strategy</h3>
            <p>
              Players are categorized into functional roles based on historical
              performance patterns using a performance-driven classification
              system. Dynamically assigned roles include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Openers (2):</b> Top-order batters with high strike rate,
                average, and boundary percentage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Middle Order (3):</b> Anchors facing more deliveries with
                solid averages who accelerate innings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Finisher (1):</b> Impact batters in lower positions with high
                strike rates finishing games under pressure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>All-Rounders (2):</b> Players meeting batting and bowling
                thresholds, contributing in both disciplines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Fast Bowlers (3):</b> Specialists with economical figures,

            <p>
              Metrics like batting average, strike rate, batting position,
              wickets, economy, and bowling strike rate determine roles. For
              example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A low-order batter with a high strike rate becomes a Finisher.
              </li>
              <li>
                A bowler with excellent economy and high wicket tally becomes a
                Fast Bowler.
              </li>
              <li>Players excelling in both are classified as All-Rounders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>📊 Scoring System</h3>
            <p>
              Each player receives a total score balancing batting and bowling
              metrics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Batting Score:</b> Batting average, strike rate, boundary
                percentage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Bowling Score:</b> Wickets, economy, pressure-building
                capabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Total Score:</b> Sum of Batting Score and Bowling Score; top
                scores within roles are selected.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🔄 Fallback Strategy</h3>
            <p>If fewer players exist in a role, fallback rules fill gaps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add extra bowler if only one all-rounder is found.</li>
              <li>
                If no all-rounders, fill slots with top-ranked Bowlers,
                Finishers, or Middle Order players.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This guarantees 11 players while preserving team balance.</p>

            <h3>Output</h3>
            <p>
              The final output is a ranked Best XI list by role type and impact
              score, supporting:
            </p>
